moment is an NPM library for manupulating and displaying dates

(1)
**********
before installing any npm package it is required to set up your application 
so that it can keep track of  the packages that are installed, 
the versions that the app is using and if could be given to another developer 
then he could easily know which packages the app is depedent upon.
`NPM INIT`
it creates a package.json file for the server
**********

(2)
**********
now getting moment library
`NPM INSTALL MOMENT --SAVE`
save is used because we like to note what library we are using in our application
and --save makes a note of it in the package.json file

`NPM INSTALL` => look at package.json and install all the dependencies.
when you don't have node_modules folder (maybe you are giving the application to some other developer)
then if package.json file has the name of the library then it will automatically install all the modules by this command `NPM INSTALL`

Using the module in the app:
let moment = require('moment');

****************************************************************************************
Global Installation
****************************************************************************************
mostly the dependencies that i need then during my development process, that means the app will run without them bit they can make the development peocess much easy.
`NPM INSTALL -G NODEMON`
this command will install the nodemon globally in my computer so that i can access it from any folder in my computer
the dependency installed globally will not be reflected to the package.json file.
